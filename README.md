This repository documents my journey and work on "Building Your First Website," my first capstone project as part of the [App Academy Open curriculum](https://free.appacademy.io/lessons/html-and-css-capstone-project/cfa83727/practices/building-your-first-website/d7710a34). The primary goal of this project is to apply and solidify fundamental HTML and CSS skills by creating a multi-page static website.

## Project Overview

This project challenged me to build a website from scratch, focusing on structure, content, and styling. It's a practical exercise designed to reinforce the concepts learned in the initial HTML and CSS modules of the App Academy Open course.

## My Learning Journey & Project Phases

The project followed a structured approach, emphasizing planning and incremental development:

### Phase 0: Setup
*   **Learning Focus**: Understanding the importance of a clean project setup.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Created a new public repository on GitHub.
    *   Cloned the repository locally.
    *   Initialized the project with a `README.md` and a `planning.md` file to outline the project scope and design.

### Phase 1: Planning
*   **Learning Focus**: The significance of pre-planning in web development. This phase was crucial for thinking through the user experience and visual design before writing any code.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Sketched the layout for each of the four required pages.
    *   Defined the HTML tags for each element on the pages.
    *   Selected fonts and a color palette to ensure a consistent look and feel.
    *   Organized graphical elements into CSS classes and mapped them to HTML elements.

### Phase 2: Construction (HTML)
*   **Learning Focus**: Building the structural backbone of a website with semantic HTML. The strategy of completing all HTML before CSS helped me concentrate on one language at a time and ensure all content and links were correctly in place.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Wrote the HTML for all four pages, ensuring all required elements were present.
    *   Thoroughly tested all internal navigation links.

### Phase 3: Styling (CSS)
*   **Learning Focus**: Bringing the website to life with CSS. This phase involved translating the design plans into functional and aesthetically pleasing styles, focusing on clarity and organization in my CSS code.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Wrote CSS classes based on the planning phase.
    *   Styled each page to be "appropriately and pleasantly styled."
    *   Ensured layout and style consistency across the site.

## Key Features Implemented

The website consists of four distinct pages, each demonstrating specific HTML and CSS skills:

### Common Elements Across All Pages:
*   **Navigation Bar**: Links to all four pages for easy site navigation.
*   **CSS Styling**: Each page is styled using CSS for a pleasant user experience.

### Page 1:
*   A main header using `<h1>`.
*   Three sections of text, each with an `<h2>` header.
*   At least one image.

### Page 2:
*   An HTML form containing:
    *   A `<fieldset>` to group related form elements.
    *   At least three `<input>` elements (two `text`, one `checkbox`).
    *   A `<textarea>`.
    *   Appropriate `<label>` elements for all form controls.
    *   A submit `<button>`.

### Page 3:
*   A main header using `<h1>`.
*   An ordered or unordered list of links to five other websites.

### Page 4:
*   A main header using `<h1>`.
*   Six images displayed in a 3-wide and 2-down grid.
*   A label for each image.
*   Functionality allowing each image, when clicked, to open its source in a new window.

## Technologies Used
*   **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
*   **CSS3**: For styling the web pages.

## How to View
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/NikVince/my-first-website.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file (or your main HTML file for Page 1) in your web browser.

## Future Considerations
*(Optional: You can add things you'd like to improve or learn next, e.g., "Implement responsive design," "Learn JavaScript to add interactivity.")*
